I have started my C++ journey back in 2020 in lockdown and even after trying to learn it from book itÂ  was very difficult for me to start so i decided to learn from youtube free tutorial and started my from from beginning and now I'am a succesful programmer in C++.C++ is a very good programming language.It gives us deep knowledge about memory management,system management etc.So my advice will be to start learning C++ as your first programming language.It might take some time like 6-7 months to clear your basic but can do it if you have self motivation to learn C++.After learning C++ you will really enjoy learning DSA(Data Structure & Algorithms).
